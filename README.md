# Hangman game

App was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Welcome to my Hangman game!!

I'm still learing React ðŸ˜„

## How to install

If you dont want to download the node_modules file, then skip this step. Navigate to the directory that you saved the download, open cmd and type` npm install` where the package.json file is located. This will setup the node_modules folder, how long this takes is different for everyone but you will see a progress indicator telling you what is happening in the console.

## Launch the game

While in the same folder as before. Open cmd and run `npm start` . This runs the Hangman game in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## How to play

Hangman is a simple word guessing game. You need to try to figure out an unknown word by guessing letters. If too many letters which do not appear in the word are guessed, the player is hanged (and loses).

Just keep guessing until you get the word right keeping the little man alive!

PS: If you need help, there is a help button to get a brief description on how to play the game!

Have fun!!
